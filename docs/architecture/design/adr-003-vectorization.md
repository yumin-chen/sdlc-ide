# ADR-003: Vectorization

## 1. Context

This ADR outlines the strategy for vectorization and embeddings. It is a dependency of ADR-001.

**Update from ADR-001:** The vectorization strategy must account for the principle that embeddings create semantic, not structural, links, and must always defer to the Orchestrator for lifecycle decisions.

## 2. Decision

## 3. Consequences
