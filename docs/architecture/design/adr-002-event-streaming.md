# ADR-002: Event Streaming

## 1. Context

This ADR defines the architecture for the event streaming layer. It is a dependency of ADR-001 and must incorporate the decisions made in that document.

**Update from ADR-001:** This ADR must define the ordering guarantees for events, especially for those related to the Core DAG artifacts. It also needs to account for events related to the "Self-Proposing Extensions Architecture," including proposal, validation, and registration events.
