# ADR-007: Failure Modes

## 1. Context

This ADR analyzes potential failure modes and defines the system's response. It is a dependency of ADR-001.

**Update from ADR-001:** This ADR must align the system's failure and recovery strategies with the event-based observer layer, ensuring that all failures and recovery actions are captured as immutable events.

## 2. Decision
